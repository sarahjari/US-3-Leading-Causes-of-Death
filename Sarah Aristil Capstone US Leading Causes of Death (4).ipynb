    "# Leading Causes of Death in the United States of America\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work with a dataset published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data, provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, shows the ten leading causes of death in the US from 1999 to 2016 (the eleventh cause is the combination of two or more causes of death.) The population representing pre-2010 relies on a per 100,000 persons estimate. The years post-2010 relies on the 2010 population census. The data itself comes from death certificates filed for residents in all fifty states and the District of Columbia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data classifies the causes of death both by demographic and disease. Each row in the dataset represents the following information: year of death, cause of death, the number of deaths, and the age-adjusted death rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The causes represented in the data: \n",
    "- Accidents (unintentional injuries) \n",
    "- All Causes                                                              \n",
    "- Alzheimer's disease                                                 \n",
    "- Stroke (cerebrovascular diseases)                                        \n",
    "- Chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRD)                              \n",
    "- Diabetes (diabetes mellitus)                                               \n",
    "- Heart Diseases                               \n",
    "- Influenza and pneumonia                                         \n",
    "- Suicide (intentional self-harm)                     \n",
    "- Cancer (malignant neoplasms)                                            \n",
    "- Kidney diseases (nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis - loss of protein/loss of blood)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four challenges to this dataset. First, certifying physicians may fail to list underlying diseases that lead to a death. This creates an underestimate of the total occurrences of the diseases found in this dataset. There is also the possibility the treating physician gives an incorrect diagnosis. This can contribute to misclassified causes of death in the dataset. Many states require a second death certificate for residents who die outside of the state. Thus, it is reasonable to assume this data may have duplicates. The data uses two different methods to gather populations estimates. Each of these methods introduce their own limitations to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analytic Questions\n",
    "We will explore the following questions:\n",
    "1. How many deaths per cause of death occurred from 1999 to 2016?\n",
    "2. What is the average cause of death per year for heart disease, cancer and stroke?\n",
    "3. What states experienced the most/least number of deaths caused by heart disease, cancer and stroke?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "According to this dataset, the top three leading causes of death in the United States from 1999 to 2016 were heart disease, cancer and stroke. California and New York experienced the most deaths caused by heart disease and cancer. California, Texas and Florida experienced the most deaths by stroke. Alaska and Wyoming experienced the least deaths of all three causes of death. "

Alaska, Wyoming experienced the least of all three causes of death. \n",

It could explore state agriculture and dietary habits. For example, the midwest consistently experienced the least amount of deaths. Is there a difference in their environment or diet? Additional research can also compare every states' federal  assistance for preventive healthcare initiatives. With the increase of data size, this study would make use of a database and SQL to further analyze across tables.\n",

    "The limitation of this dataset is that it does not include details on state population. This may be an implicit contributing factor. The states experiencing the highest deaths also have larger populations. Likewise, states experiencing the lowest number of deaths have lower populations. Information on population during this timeframe would help determine the ratio of deaths relative to state population. Another drawback is the map does not represent the District of Columbia. "
